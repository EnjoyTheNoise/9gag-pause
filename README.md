# 9GAG pause
My friend was quite annoyed that by default 9gag players hide controls + you can't pause on key.  
This script tries to fix it. (XDDD)  
Wrote it with Tampermonkey in mind, but I guess it will work on Greasemonkey as well.

## Usage
By default you pause with spacebar.

## FAQ
**1. Can I change keyboard binding?**

Yes, you can modify it in the script source. Look for `key` variable and change it.  
You can grab key code here: https://keycode.info

**2. With enabled controls, would it be possible to hide mute button?**

Yeah probably, but I don't even lurk 9gag xdd

**3. I found a bug, where can I report it?**

My brother, this is 20 lines of js, I won't be maintaining this lol  
But feel free to open Issue/PR. Cheers!
